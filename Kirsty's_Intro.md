Hi Everyone!

  My name is Kirsty Ihenetu! I am a rising senior at Barnard College of Columbia University
double majoring in Psychology and Computer Science. I am so excited for the opportunity to
work at Get Motivated Buddies(GMB) over the summer! As a college student, goal-setting is a 
central part of my life.
  Throughout my college experience, I have had conversations with my classmates about ways 
to set and achieve goals. Collaborative goal-setting has shown to be one of the best ways 
to achieve goals in my life and psychology research affirms this finding. Having a platform 
centered around accountability and collaborative goal-setting could be revolutionary in the
lives of college students which is why I am so excited to be able to contribute to the amazing
work at GMB. Over the summer I want to gain experience handling large sets of data in a real-world
context. I would also love to be able to present trends in GMB's data that illustrate the user's 
experience. I am most excited to analyze data while working alongside brillant minds
at GMB!

Thanks,
Kirsty
