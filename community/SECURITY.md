## Reporting a Bug

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to [security@buildly.io](mailto:security@buildly.io). This address can be used for all of Buildly products. We can accept only vulnerability reports at this address.

Buildly Inc will acknowledge your email and send a more detailed response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party software to the person or team maintaining that software.


## Disclosure Policy

We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it has been fixed and announced, unless you have got a response from the Buildly security team that you can do that.

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process.


## Security Announcements

We maintain a category on the community repository called [Security Announcements](https://github/buildly/docs/security-announcements),
where we will post a summary, remediation, and mitigation details for any patch containing security fixes.
